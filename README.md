# Drowsiness/Sleep Detection with ML

## General Information
This is a simple computer vision project built with Tensorflow.<br/>
Most Accidents as we know today are likely as a result of sleep/drowsiness of the
drivers (during the day or night).<br/>
To reduce the rate of this occurrence, this project uses a CNN powered model that could be embedded 
in vehicles to raise an alarm when a driver falls asleep. The fun part of this project is that
I used the same alarm Gilfoyle used in Silicon valley for his Bitcoin alarm (Napalm death Scum).

## Installation
Create a virtual env, then
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required libraries:

- tensorflow
- numpy


```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Activate virtual env and `cd` into directory.


## Technologies Used
- Machine Learning
- Tensorflow
